🧠 AI Code Review App (MERN Stack + Gemini API)
This is a full-stack web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) that allows users to write, review, and get AI-generated feedback on their code. It leverages Google's Gemini LLM API to provide intelligent and contextual code reviews, optimization suggestions, and improvement tips.

🔍 Features
📝 Live Code Editor (JavaScript syntax highlighting)

🤖 AI-Powered Code Review using Google Gemini

Backend: Node.js, Express.js

AI: Google Gemini API (gemini-2.0-flash)

🔑 How It Works
The user writes or pastes JavaScript code into the editor.

On clicking "Review", the code is sent to the backend via Axios.

The backend forwards the code as a prompt to the Gemini LLM.

The LLM returns a natural language review, which is rendered on the UI using Markdown.
